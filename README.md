Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM: This project implements a Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model predicts future stock prices based on historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance.

Features
Data Collection: Retrieves stock data from Yahoo Finance (since January 2019).
LSTM Model: Uses an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices.
Training & Evaluation: Trains the model on 80% of the data and evaluates using MAE and MAPE.
Visualization: Compares predicted vs. actual stock prices using plots.
Real-time Prediction: Predicts the most recent stock price and displays the percentage difference from the actual value.
Installation
